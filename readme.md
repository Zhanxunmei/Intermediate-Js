Dynamically typed also known as weakly typed programming languages allow conversion between unrelated types e.g Ruby, JavaScript, Perl,Python, PHP while Statically typed also known as strongly-typed programming languages does not allow implicit conversion between unrelated types e.g Java, C++ .
In JavaScript, a variable without a value and a type is said to be an "Undefined" datatype e.g; (i)let car; (ii) car =undefined (is undefined) whereas the "null" datatype has both a value and type e.g (i)let car = " "; where the value is "" and the typeof is "string" .
